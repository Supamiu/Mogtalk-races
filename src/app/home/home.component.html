If a race is running, show the leaderboard of the race. Twitch embed too.

Also put report clear form inside the race page, maybe as a dialog box

------------------

Should consider people being trackers so they manage teams and track their progress

Anyone should be able to claim a team cleared with a screenshot, even without being a member of it

Having a page for anyone to submit a clear report would be ideal, using the database to store reports
